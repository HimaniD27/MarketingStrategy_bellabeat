## Analytical Summary: Key Findings with Visuals
> * An intriguing observation arises from the fact that some participants go to bed with the intention of sleeping but do not actually achieve the desired sleep. This discrepancy between time spent in bed and actual sleep duration could indicate potential issues such as difficulty falling asleep, restless nights, or interruptions during the sleep period.
